An important note about mex
===========================

If you are using an older version of Matlab then the default mex
configuation might not work and you might need to specify various
special options so that it picks up the system compiler.

For example, if to compile C files with mex when using Matlab 2009b on
Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, you may need to customize the CC, SDKROOT and
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET options corresponding to the maci64
architecture:

CC='gcc'
SDKROOT='/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk'
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='10.7'

A mex options file including these customizations, which is just a
modified vesion of the standard gccopts.sh, is included in this
distribution as gcc-lion-opts.sh.  Copy this file into
/Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/bin and then instruct mex to use these
options with

>> mex -setup

which will copy the options to ~/.matlab/R2009b/mexopts.sh whence they
will be used as defaults, or on a file-by-file basis with

>> mex -f /Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/bin/gcc-lion-opts.sh filename.c
